            <article>My name is Hannah Ross, and I am a sophomore studying Computer
              Science with a minor in Data Science. I am passionate about using my
              technical skills to pursue a career in front-end software engineering
              or software development.<br>

              <br>

              My interest in computer science began in the summer of 2021 through a
              Girls Who Code program, where I was introduced to HTML and web development.
              Since then, my curiosity for technology has only grown, motivating me to
              continue building my skills and working toward my goals.<br>

              <br>

              Thank you for visiting my website!
